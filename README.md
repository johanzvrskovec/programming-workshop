To run the code in the example files and examples in the workshop, you will need to install and download a couple of resources.

## Setting up your programming environment

If you do not have R and an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop R programs, you will need to install these first. Please follow [this guide](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) to install R and RStudio for your platform.

## Getting the workshop files from GitHub to your computer

The workshop is hosted on GitHub in [this repository](https://github.com/johanzvrskovec/programming-workshop). You can either clone this repository using Git, or download the content by 1.) clicking the large green button saying "\< \> Code", 2.) selecting "Download ZIP", 3.) unpack the downloaded ZIP file. It should contain the workshop project directory.

After this, please follow the instructions in the file `programming-workshop.Rmd`, located in the root of the project folder.
